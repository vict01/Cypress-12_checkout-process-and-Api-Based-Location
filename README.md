- To run all the tests in headed mode (opening the web browser), so that run one after the other, with no pause, run
   - `npm test`
   
> Note about the option above: 
>   - After finishing running the test in the web browser, also it's necessary to wait for completion in the terminal console, until the HTML report opens automatically with the test results.
>   - Only this option generates HTML report. The rest only do it in the terminal console.

- To run the test by opening the Cypress UI and handle the test run at will, run
   - `npm run cy:open`
